## 🤔 Who am I?

A curious coder, an occasional philosopher, and a professional bug creator! 🐞

- 🔭 Currently working on: Taking over the world (one repo at a time) 🏴‍☠️
- 🌱 Learning: New ways to break code and then fix it (sometimes) 🛠️
- 🤖 Fun fact: My keyboard hates me because I hit backspace too much! ⌨️

## 🎯 My Interests

- 🚀 Coding & Tech (obviously!)
- 🎮 Gaming (because debugging isn't frustrating enough 😆)
- 📸 Photography (because pixels are life!)
- 🍜 Food (I mean, who doesn't love food?)
- 🌍 Traveling (because the world is too big to stay in one place!)
